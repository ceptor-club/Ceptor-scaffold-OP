Step 1: Data Model Design
Design the data models for the application's backend. This includes models for World, Campaign, Character, Session, and Notification.
Step 2: Backend API Development
Develop the backend API to handle CRUD operations for campaigns, characters, and sessions. This will involve creating new routes and controllers in the packages/backend directory.
Step 3: Frontend Development
Build the frontend components and pages for GM inputs and player game searches. This includes creating forms for campaign creation and listings for available games in the packages/nextjs/components and packages/nextjs/pages directories.
Step 4: Smart Contracts
Step 5: Testing
Write tests for your frontend components and backend API. Create new test files in the packages/nextjs/__tests__ directory.
Step 6: Deployment
Deploy your backend API and frontend. Use services like Vercel for the frontend and a suitable platform for the backend.
Step 7: Notifications System
Implement a notification system on the backend to inform users about campaign updates and session reminders.
Step 8: Documentation and Cleanup
Document all new code, update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with relevant information, and remove any unused code.
Step 9: Final Testing and Review
Conduct thorough testing of the frontend and backend, and ensure integration points with smart contracts are ready for when the contracts are deployed.
Step 10: Submission
Prepare your hackathon submission, ensuring the application meets all functional requirements and is ready for smart contract integration.
By focusing on these steps, you can build a robust frontend and backend system ready to connect with the smart contracts once they are developed by your teammate.

** Remaining steps **
3. Implement Form Functionality
Use state management (e.g., React's useState, useReducer or a library like Redux) to handle form inputs and validations.
4. Integrate API Calls
Utilize fetch or a library like axios to make API calls from the frontend to the backend for CRUD operations.
5. Routing and Navigation
Use Next.js's built-in routing to navigate between pages and handle dynamic routes (e.g., viewing a specific campaign).
6. Styling
Apply styles to your components and pages using CSS modules or a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components.
7. Frontend Testing
Write tests for your components using a library like Jest and React Testing Library.
8. State Management for User Sessions
Implement user authentication and session management to keep track of GMs and players.
9. Error Handling and User Feedback
Provide clear error messages and feedback for user actions (e.g., form submission success or failure).
10. Documentation
Document the usage of your components and pages for future reference and other developers.


To automatically assign the ccId to the GM creating the campaign, you would typically have the ccId available as part of the user's session or authentication context. Assuming you have a user authentication system in place that assigns a ccId to each user upon account creation, you can retrieve this ccId from the user's session or token when they are logged in.

1. Ensure that the session data actually includes the ccId when it's being set. This might involve checking your authentication flow or wherever the session data is populated.
2. If you're using a custom User model on the backend, make sure that the ccId is included in the JWT token or session object that's being created upon user authentication.
